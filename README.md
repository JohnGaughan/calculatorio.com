## Important Notice

This repository is dead for now, maybe permanently.

* I lost the domain name due to details I won't get into in public but the short version is I was super busy, didn't notice a hosting issue, and it is too late now.
* Space Age happened which changed a lot. It adds a bunch of new complexity, and the Factorio UI now provides more information which makes several of the calculators here obsolete.
* Some of the information on this site rolled into the Factorio Cheat Sheet with my permission.
* When I do have time I will probably look at the information gaps between the Cheat Sheet and Factorio UI, then fill those gaps by contributing to the Cheat Sheet instead of resurrecting this project.
* Maintaining even a low-effort site is not something I can do with any punctuality at the present time due to personal commitments.
