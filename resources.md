If you are new to Factorio and are interested in learning by watching, I recommend [KatherineOfSky's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTIV3KbAvaGEyNjoMoNaGtQ). She has a great gift of being able to explain things in a way that is easy to understand and rarely assumes much in the way of previous knowledge. Even an absolute beginner can learn from her, although you should probably look for her beginner-oriented videos in that case.

[Xterminator has a good YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5StrkKVnU2xkjV0mVJ9yTw) as well. I have not watched many of his videos but the ones I have seen are informative and funny. I love watching him get [run over by trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2M8WrEtosI).
