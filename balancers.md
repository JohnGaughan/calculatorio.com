## About belt balancers

Belt balancers redistribute items evenly between belts. More specifically, they are used to draw items evenly from input belts when the outputs are not used evenly.

Imagine a train station with multiple cargo wagons emptying into multiple chests, and then onto multiple belts. If resource consumption is uneven, then some wagons may empty completely while others are still mostly full. You may actually have empty belts going all the way to assembling machines or other consumers, while others are full but stationary because of lack of demand.

Add a belt balancer in there: it will cause consumers to draw evenly from all suppliers.

Belt balancers are also great when you need to reduce the number of belts. Perhaps you have six belts from from a train, and they are all roughly two-thirds full. You could use a six-to-four balancer to _reduce_ the number of belts so they are all full, as well as drawing evenly from the cargo wagons.

A future article will go into more detail on balancers, but for now, [the official wiki discusses their mechanics in more detail](https://wiki.factorio.com/Balancer_mechanics). This page simply lists the balancers that have since been removed from the wiki, minus the trivial ones.

## Blueprint strings

The following links open in a new window and contain blueprint books for balancers of each belt tier. Copy the contents to the system clipboard, then use the import from string feature in the game and paste them into the box, one at a time.
